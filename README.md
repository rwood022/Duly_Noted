# Duly_Noted

## Description
I motivated to execute this project because I wanted to create an app that was both useful and practical. 
The reason for building this assignment was to develop a note taker that made it very simply to create and view notes. 
The issue that this projects aims to correct is to help those have many tasks throughout their workday, keep track of said task. 
I learned about creating apis, writing GET,POST, and DELETE routes, and deploying an application to Heroku.
